## 🚀 Key Components

### 1. CLI Interface (`cli.py`)
- **Commands**: `run`, `extract`, `transform`, `load`, `download`, `init-db`
- **Rich console integration** with progress bars and colored output
- **Flexible execution modes**: full pipeline, individual phases, extract-only, etc.

### 2. Pipeline Orchestrator (`pipeline.py`)
- **Async/await pattern** throughout
- **Memory management** for large datasets (file-based overflow)
- **Error handling and retry logic**
- **Price data integration** for USD value calculations
- **Incremental processing** support

### 3. Database Layer (Enhanced)
- **Three-schema architecture**: STG (staging), ODS (operational data store), DM (data mart)
- **SQLAlchemy async models** for all entities
- **Database initialization** with schema creation and data migration
- **Upsert operations** for efficient data loading
- **Comprehensive indexing** for query performance

### 4. Mapping System (✅ Completed as Requested)
- **AddressMapping**: 12 addresses (7 pools, staking contracts, protocol addresses)
- **AssetMapping**: 12 assets with normalization, formatting, and categorization
- **FunctionMapping**: 30+ functions across swap, staking, liquidity, governance categories
- **Integration**: Fully integrated with transformer classes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with integration tests

### 5. Data Models
- **Blockchain models**: Raw transaction data, swap events, staking events
- **Database models**: Three-schema structure with proper relationships
- **Type safety**: Full type hints and Pydantic validation

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- ✅ **27 passing tests** covering configuration and mappings
- ✅ **Fixed test imports** to match actual class-based implementation
- ✅ **Integration tests** verifying mapping system consistency
- ✅ **Poetry dependency management** with proper versioning
- ✅ **Code formatting** with Black and isort applied
- ✅ **Type checking** ready with mypy configuration

## 🔧 Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Initialize database (when ready)
poetry run puzzle-etl init-db
